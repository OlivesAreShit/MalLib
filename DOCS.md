## The Basics:


MalLib is split up into a few main categories; get, gottem, and other (I'm aware these are stupid names, I originally made it for a friend). Get is getting information about anything, the user, machine, or even the OS. Gottem is actually doing things like opening a link, this is where you do a little bit of trolling. Finally, other is just things I don't know how to categorize into get and gottem or they don't fit, ex. Discord webhooks.
