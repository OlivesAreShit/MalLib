# MalLib


A Java library for making malware. For LEARNING purposes only, I won't include anything super harmful.


## Features:

- Getting information about the user, machine, and the OS

- Do a little bit of trolling ;)

- Send things through Discord or Guilded webhooks

- Easy to use, good for Java amateurs and masters


## Guide:


To use the library download the latest release from the releases tab and add it to your build path. The library is made and exported Java 8 so that is recommended when using this library.


## Note:


I am **NOT** responsible for any damage caused by this. I'm making this purely out of boredom so you can commit if you want I guess.
